Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly 
11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary. 
Ans: List, tuple, set and dictionary are inbuilt data structures in python.
List => mutable and heterogeneous in nature
Tuple => immutable, ordered but heterogeneous in nature
Set => stores distinct values of same type, i.e. homogeneous  
Dictionary => key, value pair of associations where all keys belong to same datatype and all values belong to same datatypes 

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’ with space in python. 
Ans: No, strings in python are not mutable. i.e. we cannot over-write the value of the string.
 Code Snippet: x = “I+Love+Python”
x.replace('+',' ')
Output: ‘I Love Python'

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting the datatype of a variable in python. 
Ans: the ord() function in python gives the ascii code of the character.
e.g. ord(‘A’)  gives 65 
To get the datatype of a variable use the type() function 
e.g. a = 1   type(a) gives int

Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook. 
14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥2+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0. Where a, b and c are to be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0.
