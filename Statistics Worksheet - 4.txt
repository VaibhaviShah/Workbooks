Q10and Q15 are subjective answer type questions, Answer them in your own words briefly.
10. What do you understand by the term Normal Distribution?
Ans: It is a probability funtion which describes the distribution of variables. 
it is a symmetrical distribution, where most of the observations are clustered around the centre 

11. How do you handle missing data? What imputation techniques do you recommend?
Ans: Missing values can be imputed by using mean, median, mode

12. What is A/B testing
Ans: A/B testing is the act of running a simultaneous experiment between two or more variables

13. Is mean imputation of missing data acceptable practice?
Ans: yes. It is an acceptable practise

14. What is linear regression in statistics?
Ans: In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables. 
The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression

15. What are the various branches of statistics?
Ans: the branches of statistics are descriptive and Inferential
